# NestJS + Docker: Good Defaults for Production-Ready Services

> Inspired by best practices from talented practitioners like Brett Fisher, whose guidance I‚Äôve followed for over a decade.

This repository demonstrates how I package and run NestJS applications with Docker using opinionated defaults that
balance simplicity, performance, and maintainability.

Most examples online either stop at a Dockerfile for local testing or drown you in Kubernetes/CI/CD specifics.
This repo focuses on the middle ground: good defaults that actually work for production microservices, without
overengineering.

## Why Another NestJS + Docker Example?

- Real-world context. These defaults are based on proven best practices for production-ready Node.js services using NestJS.
- Optimized for DX and Ops. Simple to build, secure, and predictable images suitable for production.
- Patterns, not snippets. You can reuse this structure across projects, not just copy/paste a Dockerfile.

## Key Principles

1. Security first. Use node:22-alpine (current LTS, small, maintained, minimal attack surface).
2. Multi-stage builds. Keep images small by separating build and runtime stages.
3. Reproducibility. Deterministic installs (npm ci / pnpm install --frozen-lockfile).
4. Non-root runtime. Containers drop privileges ‚Üí run as unprivileged user.
5. Operational hygiene. Containers provide health checks and log cleanly.

## What's Inside

This template provides two main components that work together to create a production-ready NestJS application:

### üê≥ Part 1: NestJS + Docker Baseline

**Production-ready containerization with security and performance best practices:**

- **Multi-stage Dockerfile** ‚Üí build stage with all dependencies, runtime stage with only what's needed
- **External healthcheck script** for container health monitoring
- **Security hardening** with non-root user, minimal attack surface, and cleanup procedures
- **Build arguments** for Node version, version metadata, and build date customization
- **Graceful shutdown** with proper signal handling
- **Optimized for production** with minimal attack surface and reproducible builds

### üõ†Ô∏è Part 2: Code Quality & Development Tools

**Enterprise-grade development workflow that balances strictness with developer experience:**

- **ESLint configuration** with TypeScript rules, production vs test environment handling
- **Prettier formatting** with TypeScript-specific indentation (4 spaces) and 120-character line length
- **Husky Git hooks** for pre-commit linting and pre-push coverage validation
- **lint-staged** for automated code quality checks on staged files only
- **Coverage thresholds** (80%) enforced in Jest, pre-push hooks, and CI pipeline
- **Unit test isolation** with proper mocking and test structure
- **GitHub Actions CI workflow** with branch-specific strategies for automated quality gates

### üîí Part 3: Security Headers

**Production-ready security configuration with essential HTTP security headers:**

- **Helmet middleware** with essential security headers for JSON APIs
- **X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection** for basic security
- **HSTS configuration** with proper HTTPS enforcement settings
- **Security header testing** with comprehensive e2e test coverage
- **Centralized configuration** in `src/config/helmet.config.ts` for easy customization

## Usage

### Docker Build & Run

#### Basic Build

Build the production image with default settings:

```shell
docker build -t my-nest-service:latest .
```

#### Custom Node Version

Build with a specific Node.js version:

```shell
docker build --build-arg NODE_VERSION=20 -t my-nest-service:latest .
```

#### With Version and Build Date

Build with custom version and timestamp:

```shell
docker build \
  --build-arg VERSION=1.0.0 \
  --build-arg BUILD_DATE=$(date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ') \
  -t my-nest-service:1.0.0 .
```

#### Run the Container

```shell
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 my-nest-service:latest
```

#### Health Check

The container includes an external health check script that runs every 30 seconds:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 my-nest-service:latest
```

### Development Workflow

#### Code Quality Checks

```shell
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Fix formatting
npm run format

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:cov

# Run e2e tests (includes security header tests)
npm run test:e2e
```

#### Git Hooks (Automatic)

- **Pre-commit**: Runs ESLint and Prettier on staged files
- **Pre-push**: Runs full test suite with coverage validation

#### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Feature branches**: Automatic lint + build validation on pull requests
- **Main branch**: Full CI with tests, coverage, and security audits
- **Coverage enforcement**: 80% threshold required for all code

## Configuration

### Coverage Thresholds

Customize coverage requirements in `package.json`:

```json
"jest": {
  "coverageThreshold": {
    "global": {
      "branches": 80,    // Branch coverage percentage
      "functions": 80,   // Function coverage percentage
      "lines": 80,       // Line coverage percentage
      "statements": 80   // Statement coverage percentage
    }
  }
}
```

### Husky Git Hooks

Git hooks are automatically configured. To customize:

**Pre-commit hook** (`.husky/pre-commit`):

```bash
npm run lint:staged
```

**Pre-push hook** (`.husky/pre-push`):

```bash
npm run test:cov  # Runs tests with coverage validation
```

### ESLint Configuration

Modify rules in `eslint.config.mjs`:

- **Production code**: Strict TypeScript rules with warnings for best practices
- **Test files**: Relaxed rules for testing flexibility
- **Line length**: 120 characters (configurable in `max-len` rule)

### Prettier Formatting

Customize formatting in `.prettierrc`:

```json
{
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "arrowParens": "avoid",
  "printWidth": 120,
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": "*.ts",
      "options": { "tabWidth": 4 }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Helmet Security Configuration

Security headers are configured in [`src/config/helmet.config.ts`](./src/config/helmet.config.ts) with essential protections:

- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Powered-By removal**: Hides Express version information
- **DNS Prefetch Control**: Prevents DNS prefetching
- **HSTS**: Enforces HTTPS in production (disabled in development)
- **IE Download Options**: Prevents IE from executing downloads

The configuration is environment-aware and can be customized for your specific security requirements.

### CI Workflow Customization

Modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

- **Node version**: Change `node-version: '22'` to your preferred version
- **Coverage thresholds**: Adjust Jest configuration (see above)
- **Job conditions**: Modify `if` conditions for different branch behaviors

## Why This Matters

NestJS is a powerful framework, but without solid packaging and deployment practices, you end up with bloated, brittle
containers. This repo is my baseline ‚Äúgood defaults‚Äù setup: not perfect, but safe, lean, and production-friendly
out of the box.
