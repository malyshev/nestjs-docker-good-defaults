#  - npm automatically skips devDependencies

#  - dist (compiled JS code of NestJS)
#  - node_modules (installed dependencies)
#  - package*.json (for npm scripts or metadata)

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cleanup unnecessary files for runtime
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In production, we only need:
#  - compiled JavaScript code (dist/)
#  - production node_modules/
# Everything else can be removed to reduce image size and attack surface.
#
# Security rationale:
# 1. Removing package managers (npm, yarn) prevents installing new packages inside the container.
# 2. Removing package.json/yarn.lock/package-lock.json avoids leaking dependency metadata.
# 3. Smaller attack surface: fewer binaries and configs reduce potential vulnerabilities.
#
# Note: Only do this if you do NOT need to run npm/yarn scripts in production.
